Hi there!

I am a psychologist, neuroscientist and research software engineer currently working in the social science sector at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/).
I am also an honorary research fellow of the [Oxford's Department of Education](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/) where I worked as a postdoc before joining the escience center.
