Hi there!

I am a research software engineer working at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) whereby I help researchers across the Social Sciences and Humanities to develop open, accessible, and user-friendly software for the wider scientific community. At the same time, I am a honorary research fellow of the [Oxford's Department of Education](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/) where I combine my scientific background with my software development skills to code reliable and engaging digital experiments for large-scale data collection with children and adults.
