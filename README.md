Hi there!

I am a Data Scientist working in the [ABN AMRO Group Economics](https://www.abnamro.com/en/research). I collaborate with researchers with an Economics/Econometrics background to develop open, accessible, and user-friendly software to uncover patterns in human spending behaviour. 

At the same time, I am a honorary research fellow of the [Oxford's Department of Education](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/). Here, I leverage both my background as a Researcher and my software development expertise to design robust and engaging digital experiments. These experiments facilitate large-scale data collection with both children and adults.
